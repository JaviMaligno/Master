Different notions of homotopy Gerstenhaber algebras are discussed: One of them is a B$\infty$-algebra, another, called a homotopy G-algebra, is a particular case of a B$\infty$-algebra, the others, a G$\infty$-algebra, an E1-algebra, and a weak G$\infty$-algebra, arise from the geometry of configuration spaces.

@article{p._may_simplicial_1992,

	abstract = {Simplicial sets are discrete analogs of topological spaces. They have played a central role in algebraic topology ever since their introduction in the late 1940s, and they also play an important role in other areas such as geometric topology and algebraic geometry. On a formal level, the homotopy theory of simplicial sets is equivalent to the homotopy theory of topological spaces. In view of this equivalence, one can apply discrete, algebraic techniques to perform basic topological constructions. These techniques are particularly appropriate in the theory of localization and completion of topological spaces, which was developed in the early 1970s. Since it was first published in 1967, Simplicial Objects in Algebraic Topology has been the standard reference for the theory of simplicial sets and their relationship to the homotopy theory of topological spaces. J. Peter May gives a lucid account of the basic homotopy theory of simplicial sets, together with the equivalence of homotopy theories alluded to above. The central theme is the simplicial approach to the theory of fibrations and bundles, and especially the algebraization of fibration and bundle theory in terms of "twisted Cartesian products." The Serre spectral sequence is described in terms of this algebraization. Other topics treated in detail include Eilenberg-MacLane complexes, Postnikov systems, simplicial groups, classifying complexes, simplicial Abelian groups, and acyclic models. "Simplicial Objects in Algebraic Topology presents much of the elementary material of algebraic topology from the semi-simplicial viewpoint. It should prove very valuable to anyone wishing to learn semi-simplicial topology. [May] has included detailed proofs, and he has succeeded very well in the task of organizing a large body of previously scattered material."{\^a}??Mathematical Review},

	url = {https://idus.us.es/xmlui/handle/11441/77489},
	abstract = {The word problem, the conjugacy problem and the isomorphism problem were three fundamental problems of group theory proposed by Max Dehn.  We will deal with the first one. This problem consists of: given a group G with a finite presentation hS{\textbar}Ri and given two elements A, B ? G as a product of elements of S and their inverses, decide whether A = B as elements of the group or, equivalently, whether AB-1 = e, where e denotes the identity element. The name of this problem comes from the fact that we can consider the alphabet $\Sigma$ = S ? S -1, where S -1 is the set of inverses of the elements of S, and view G as a language over $\Sigma$, where two words A and B represent the same element if and only if one can transform A into B in a finite amount of steps using the rewriting rules given by R and the inverse cancellation. 
Dehn described algorithms to solve the word problem for the fundamental groups of closed orientable two-dimensional manifolds of genus greater than or equal to 2. However, in 1955 Pyotr Novikov found examples of finitely presented groups where the word problem is undecidable, i.e., there cannot be any algorithm to solve it. Nevertheless, the word problem is solvable for many groups. Clear examples of this are the finite groups and the free groups. Here we study the word problem in the braid groups. These groups appear in many branches of mathematics such as algebra, topology and analysis, and the word problem is known to be solvable for them. This project begins giving different equivalent definitions of the braid groups, starting from the intuitive idea of geometric braid. Each definition will give a different 
perspective and they will provide us more tools to solve the word problem. At the end of the first chapter we shall give some additional definitions and results that will be very important for the rest of the project. In the second chapter we will explain the first known algorithm to solve the word problem in the braid groups, based on representing braids as automorphisms of a free 
group. In the third chapter we will see another method, called braid combing, based on the solvability of the word problem for the free groups. In the fourth chapter we will explore the Garside structure of the braid groups, which will allow us to solve the word problem by means of a normal form of the elements of the group. In the last chapter, we will present some examples of linear representations that generate another algorithm to solve the word problem. In every chapter there will be concrete examples of solutions of the word problem using each one of the presented methods.},

We show that the quantization procedure of [EK] is given by universal acyclic formulas and defines a functor from the category of Lie bialgebras to the category of quantized universal enveloping algebras. We also show that this functor defines an equivalence between the category of Lie bialgebras over k [[h]] and the category of quantized universal enveloping (QUE) algebras.},

	abstract = {These are Lecture Notes of a course given by the author at the French-Spanish School "Tresses in Pau", held in Pau (France) in October 2009. It is basically an introduction to distinct approaches and techniques that can be used to show results in braid groups. Using these techniques we provide several proofs of well known results in braid groups, namely the correctness of Artin's presentation, that the braid group is torsion free, or that its center is generated by the full twist. We also recall some solutions of the word and conjugacy problems, and that roots of a braid are always conjugate. We also describe the centralizer of a given braid. Most proofs are classical ones, using modern terminology. I have chosen those which I find simpler or more beautiful.
