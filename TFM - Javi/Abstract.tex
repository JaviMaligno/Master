The Hochschild cohomology of an associative algebra over a ring carries an structure of Gerstenhaber algebra, which is equivalent to an action by the homology of the little disks operad. The Deligne conjecture asks whether this actions lifts to an action by the singular chains of the little disks operad on the Hochschild complex of the associative algebra. In this thesis we review some aspects of the first historical proof of this conjecture, due to Tamarkin and Kontsevich, which is valid when the ring is a field of characteristic zero.
